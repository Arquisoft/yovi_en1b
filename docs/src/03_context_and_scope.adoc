== Context and Scope

This section delimits the *GameY* system from all its external communication partners. It defines the boundaries and the interfaces between our system and its environment, both from a business/domain perspective and a technical perspective.

=== Business Context

The business context focuses on the external entities (actors) that interact with the GameY system from a functional point of view, ignoring technical details.

*Explanation of external domain interfaces:*

|===
| Communication Partner | Inputs (to the System) | Outputs (from the System)

| *User / Player*
| Username for registration (RegisterForm), game actions.
| Welcome messages, UI rendering.
|===


=== Technical Context

This section describes the technical interfaces, channels, and transmission media linking the GameY system to its environment. Based on the docker-compose configuration, the project is divided into a frontend application (webapp), a backend for user handling (users), and a game engine (gamey).

}

node "GameY Server Infrastructure" {
  [users\n(Node.js/Express)] as users
  [gamey\n(Rust)] as gamey
}

webapp --> users : HTTP (Port 3000)
webapp --> gamey : HTTP (Port 4000)

*Mapping Input/Output to Channels:*

|===
| Communication Partner | I/O | Channel / Protocol

| *User (Client Device)*
| UI interactions, form submissions (e.g., sending username).
| *HTTP* for fetching the SPA from the webapp service (Port 80). Once loaded, the browser communicates via *HTTP POST* with the users service API (/createuser on Port 3000) and the gamey engine (Port 4000).
