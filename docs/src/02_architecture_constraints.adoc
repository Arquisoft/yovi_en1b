== Architecture Constraints

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Any requirement that constraints software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and conventions.

=== Technical Constraints

[cols="1,2,3,3",options="header"]
|===
| Constraint ID | Constraint | Impact | Rationale

| TC-01
| **Mandatory Tech Stack**
| Web application must use **TypeScript**; core game logic (move validation/generation) must be in **Rust**.
| Requirement defined by the ASW course to practice polyglot development and language interoperability.

| TC-02
| **Communication Protocol**
| Subsystems must communicate via **JSON messages**.
| Standardizes data exchange between the TypeScript frontend and the Rust backend service.

| TC-03
| **Game Representation (YEN)**
| All game states and moves must be represented using the **YEN notation**.
| Ensures consistency in how the Game Y board is serialized and stored across the system.

| TC-04
| **Architecture Decomposition**
| System must be split into at least two subsystems: **Web Application** and **Rust-based web service**.
| Encourages modularity and demonstrates the ability to integrate different architectural components.

| TC-05
| **External API**
| The system must expose a documented API for third-party bots.
| Facilitates extensibility and allows the game to be played by automated agents.

| TC-06
| **Public Deployment**
| The application must be accessible via a public URL.
| Demonstrates the ability to manage cloud deployment and production environments.

=== Organizational Constraints

[cols="1,2,3,3",options="header"]
|===
| Constraint ID | Constraint | Impact | Rationale

| OC-01
| **Version Control**
| All source code and documentation must be hosted in the assigned **GitHub repository** (Arquisoft/yovi_en1b).
| Enables collaborative development and allows instructors to track progress and contributions.

| OC-02
| **Automated CI/CD**
| Deployment and testing must be automated using CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions).
| Ensures software quality and rapid feedback loops throughout the development lifecycle.

| OC-03
| **Documentation Standards**
| Use of the **arc42 template** and **ADRs** (Architectural Decision Records) is mandatory.
| Provides a standardized structure for architectural documentation and history of key decisions.
|===

=== Conventions

[cols="1,2,3,3",options="header"]
|===
| Constraint ID | Constraint | Impact | Rationale

| C-01
| **Testing Requirements**
| Mandatory inclusion of Unit, Integration, E2E, and Load tests.
| Critical for verifying system reliability and performance under stress.

| C-02
| **AI Strategy Options**
| The AI must offer at least two different strategies or difficulty levels.
| Enhances user experience and demonstrates implementation of different algorithmic approaches.

| C-03
| **Language**
| All documentation and code comments should be in **English**.
| Standard practice in software engineering.
