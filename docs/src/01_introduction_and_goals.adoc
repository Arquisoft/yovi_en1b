=== Requirements Overview

The **YOVI_EN1B** project represents an evolving multi service platform developed for the Software Architecture course at the University of Oviedo. It serves as a fundamental benchmark for the construction of scalable, maintainable, and observable distributed systems, with a specific focus on turn based game logic.

The following context diagram illustrates the primary boundaries of the system and its interactions with external actors and infrastructure:

actor "Player" as user

package "YOVI_EN1B System" {
    component "Web Application" as webapp
    component "Users Service" as users_src
    component "Gamey Engine" as gamey
}

database "Database" as db
component "Monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)" as monitor

user --> webapp : "Plays game / Registers"

webapp <-> users_src : "Authentication"

The functional scope encompasses several critical architectural domains:

*   **User Identity Management**: A centralized system for registration and authentication, providing secure access to the platform ecosystem. This component ensures the integrity of user credentials and session management.
*   **Hexagonal Game Logic Engine**: A high performance application core, implemented in Rust, that governs spatial operations on a triangular board consisting of hexagonal cells. This includes move validation based on spatial adjacency, distributed state synchronization, and win condition detection via specialized graph traversal algorithms such as Depth First Search.
*   **State Persistence and Resilience**: Integration with MongoDB to ensure that all game sessions are preserved. This mechanism enables the system to survive service interruptions and allows participants to resume active sessions without loss of progress. It is a critical component for maintaining system availability and reliability.
*   **Operational Intelligence**: A comprehensive monitoring infrastructure using Prometheus and Grafana to provide real time visibility into system health and performance metrics. This allows for automated alerting and detailed analysis of system behavior under load.

=== Quality Goals

The architecture of YOVI_EN1B is governed by a technical quality tree rooted in the ISO 25010 standard. These high priority requirements ensure the technical integrity and operational success of the platform:

|===
|Priority|Goal|Architectural Attribute|Operational Scenario
|1|**Maintainability**|Modularity|The system architecture facilitates the replacement of individual components, such as the user service, without necessitating modifications to the web application or the game engine core. This decoupling ensures long term project sustainability.
|2|**Reliability**|Fault Tolerance|The persistence layer ensures that in the event of a service restart, the complete game state is recovered from the database within two seconds, ensuring zero data loss for active sessions.
|3|**Performance**|Efficiency|The core game logic executes spatial analysis and win condition detection in under two milliseconds. This performance target must be maintained even as the triangular grid size increases, ensuring immediate system response times.
|4|**Security**|Data Integrity|The platform enforces strict validation of all incoming requests to prevent unauthorized actions. Every transaction is recorded to maintain a full audit trail for accountability and evaluation purposes.
|5|**Usability**|Accessibility|The user interface provides immediate clarity regarding system state and gameplay progression. It adheres to modern standards to ensure that the complex hexagonal grid remains intuitive for all users.
